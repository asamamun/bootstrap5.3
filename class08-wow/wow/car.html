        <h1><Strong>Cars Tesla, Inc.</Strong></h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Tesla announced the Tesla Autopilot, a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla
            cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called
            "hardware version 1".
            <br>

            Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its Tesla Powerwall (home) and Tesla Powerpack (business)
            battery packs in April 2015. The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the
            unveiling.
            <br>
            Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV Tesla Model X, in September 2015, which had 25,000
            pre-orders at the time.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Tesla was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla Motors. Its name is a
            tribute
            to inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, Elon Musk led Tesla's first funding
            round and
            became the company's chairman; in 2008, he was named chief executive officer. In 2008, the company began
            production of its first car model, the Roadster sports car, followed by the Model S sedan in 2012, the Model
            X SUV
            in 2015, the Model 3 sedan in 2017, the Model Y crossover in 2020, the Tesla Semi truck in 2022 and the
            Cybertruck
            pickup truck in 2023.</p>
