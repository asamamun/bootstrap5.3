        <hr style="color: aliceblue;">
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">Grok is a neologism coined by the American writer Robert A. Heinlein for his 1961
          science
          fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land. While the Oxford English Dictionary summarizes the meaning
          of grok as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or
          communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment", Heinlein's concept is far
          more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that "the book's major theme can be
          seen as an extended definition of the term." The concept of grok garnered significant critical
          scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication. The term and aspects of the underlying
          concept have become part of communities such as computer science. </p>

        <hr style="color: aliceblue;">
        <p style="color: aliceblue;">SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with internal
          funding.The
          Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. The total development cost
          of Falcon 1 was approximately $90 million to $100 million. <br>
          The Falcon rocket series was named after Star Wars's Millennium Falcon fictional spacecraft. <br>
          In 2004, SpaceX protested against NASA to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) because of a
          sole-source contract awarded to Kistler Aerospace. Before the GAO could respond, NASA withdrew the
          contract, and formed the COTS program.: 109-110 In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a
          human-rated commercial space program through the end of the decade, a program that would later
          become the Dragon spacecraft.In 2006, the company was selected by NASA and awarded $396 million
          to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts to the International Space Station (ISS)
          under the COTS program.</p>

      In January 2017, Musk proxies approached Pedram Mohseni and Randolph Nudo, who owned the rights to the name

      They made significant progress and completed preliminary testing but did not receive enough funding or support
      from investors to continue: "The pair of longtime neurotech researchers had developed a device that might help
      people with brain injuries. But their initial contacts with investors hadn't advanced very far when a stranger
      approached them offering tens of thousands of dollars for their company's name. They accepted. No one mentioned

        <p style="color: aliceblue;">In 1905, Albert Einstein published his special theory of relativity, which
          led to the concept that space and time can be viewed as a single construct known as spacetime. In
          this theory, the speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers—which has the result that
          two events that appear simultaneous to one particular observer will not be simultaneous to another
          observer if the observers are moving with respect to one another. Moreover, an observer will measure
          a moving clock to tick more slowly than one that is stationary with respect to them; and objects are
          measured to be shortened in the direction that they are moving with respect to the observer.</p>

      <h3 style="font-weight: bold;" class="p-2 text-center mt-4">A TWITTER TAKE OVER - ELON MUSK</h3>

      <p class="p-3 text-justify">The business magnate Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of American social media
        company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of
        the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake.
        Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April
        14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter's board responded with a "poison
        pill" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk's buyout offer of $44 billion on
        April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms
        open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech, framing the acquisition as the cornerstone of X,
        an "everything app". In July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter
        had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against
        Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17.
        Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the
        acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter's new owner and CEO.
        Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top
        executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid
        off half of the company's workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an
        ultimatum demanding they commit to "extremely hardcore" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In
        July 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X. Reactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk's
        planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over
        fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform.
        Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former
        Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk's intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash
        for his handling of the company and account suspensions, including the December 2022 suspensions of ten
        journalists. </p>

                  <h4><Strong>Elon Musk</Strong></h4>
                  <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Businessman & Engineer</p>
                  <p>Since 2025, he has been a senior advisor to President Donald Trump and head of the Department of
                    Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk is the wealthiest person in the world; as of February 2025,
                    Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$384 billion. </p>
                  <p><strong>Background:</strong> Musk was born to an affluent South African family in Pretoria before
                    immigrating to Canada, acquiring Canadian citizenship via his mother. He moved to California in 1995
                    to attend Stanford University, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the software company Zip2,
                    which was acquired by Compaq in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank, that
                    later formed PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired U.S. citizenship, and eBay acquired PayPal. Using the
                    money he made from the sale, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004,
                    Musk was an early investor in electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla and became its chairman and later
                    CEO. In 2018, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk for fraud, alleging he
                    falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla; he stepped down as
                    chairman and paid a fine. Musk was named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2021. In 2022, he
                    acquired Twitter, and rebranded the service as X the following year. In January 2025, he was
                    appointed head of Trump's newly created DOGE.</p>

                  <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Entrepreneur & Engineer</p>
                  <p>Marc Tarpenning was born in Sacramento, California, on June 1, 1964. He attended the University
                    of California, Berkeley, and obtained a B.A. degree in computer science in 1985.</p>
                  <p><strong>Background:</strong> After graduating from Berkeley, Tarpenning spent several years working
                    for Textron in Saudi Arabia. Tarpenning then developed software and firmware products for
                    several companies, including Seagate Technology and Bechtel, and later served as vice president of
                    engineering at Packet Design, a network technology company. In 1997, Tarpenning and Martin
                    Eberhard founded NuvoMedia, a company that built an early e-book reader, the RocketBook, in 1998.
                    In 2000, Gemstar-TV Guide International acquired NuvoMedia for $187 million. <br>
                    In 2003, Tarpenning and Martin Eberhard collaborated again and founded Tesla Motors (now Tesla
                    Inc.). The two co-founders funded the company until early 2004, when Elon Musk led the company's
                    $6.5 million Series A financing round in February 2004 and became the chairman of the board.
                    Tarpenning continued to serve as the chief financial officer (CFO) and the Vice President of
                    Electrical Engineering in Tesla until 2008.</p>
