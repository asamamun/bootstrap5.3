        <p style="text-align: justify;">Grok means "to understand", of course, but Dr. Mahmoud, who might be termed the
            leading Terran expert on Martians, explains that it also means, "to drink" and "a hundred other English
            words, words which we think of as antithetical concepts. 'Grok' means all of these. It means 'fear', it
            means 'love', it means 'hate' - proper hate, for by the Martian 'map' you cannot hate anything unless you
            grok it, understand it so thoroughly that you merge with it and it merges with you - then you can hate it.
            By hating yourself. But this implies that you love it, too, and cherish it and would not have it otherwise.
            Then you can hate - and (I think) Martian hate is an emotion so black that the nearest human equivalent
            could only be called mild distaste.
            <br>


        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Musk co-founded the AI research organization OpenAI with Sam Altman in 2015.
            Musk left the company's board in 2018, saying of his decision that he "didn't agree with some of what OpenAI
            team wanted to do".TruthGPT would later become known as "Grok", a verb coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his
            1961 science-fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land to describe a form of understanding.
            <br>
            OpenAI went on to launch ChatGPT in 2022, and GPT-4 in March 2023. It was announced that once the bot was
            out
            of early beta, it would only be available to higher tier X Premium+ subscribers. At the time of the preview,
            xAI described the chatbot as "a very early beta product the best we could do with 2 months of training"
            that could "improve rapidly with each passing week".
            <br>
            That month, Elon Musk was one of the individuals to sign the "Pause Giant AI Experiments" open letter from
            the Future of Life Institute, which called for a six-month pause in the development of any AI software more
            powerful than GPT-4.In April 2023, Elon Musk said in an interview on Tucker Carlson Tonight that he intended
            to develop an AI chatbot called "TruthGPT", which he described as "a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to
            understand the nature of the universe".

                    <br>
                    Grok means "identically equal". The human cliché "This hurts me worse than it does you" has a
                    distinctly Martian flavor. The Martian seems to know instinctively what we learned painfully from
                    modern physics, that observer acts with observed through the process of observation. Grok means to
                    understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed to merge, blend,
                    intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion,
                    philosophy, and science and it means as little to us as color does to a blind man.
