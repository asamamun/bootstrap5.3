            <div class="w-100">
            The issue with object-fit: contain not working as expected inside a Bootstrap col-3 in Bootstrap 5.3.3 likely stems from the fact that object-fit requires the image to have explicit dimensions (i.e., a defined width and height) to function properly. Without these, the browser doesn't know how to scale the image while maintaining its aspect ratio within the container. Bootstrap's grid system (col-3) controls the width of the column, but it doesn’t inherently impose a height or ensure the image adheres to object-fit without additional styling.

Here’s why this happens and how to fix it:
<br>
Why It’s Not Working
<br>
No Explicit Height: The img element, by default, doesn’t have a height set. object-fit: contain needs both width and height to determine how to fit the image within those boundaries. Without a height, the image may stretch or behave unpredictably. <br>
Bootstrap’s Responsive Images: In Bootstrap 5, images are often implicitly styled with max-width: 100% and height: auto (via the .img-fluid class or default browser behavior), which can interfere with object-fit if not overridden properly. <br>
Container Constraints: The col-3 class sets a width (25% of the container), but the image might overflow or not scale correctly if its natural size exceeds the column’s dimensions and no height is defined.

To make object-fit: contain work, you need to: <br>

Set an explicit width and height on the image or its container. <br>
Ensure the image respects the column's boundaries while maintaining its aspect ratio.
